  (a) Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the
  loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set
  to the correct location for the data.

```{r}
college = read.csv(file = 'College.csv')
```

  (b) Look at the data using the fix() function.
  
```{r}
fix(college)
```
  
  ...You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university.
  We donâ€™t really want R to treat this as data. 
  However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:
```{r}
rownames(college) = college[,1]
fix(college)
```
  
  ...You should see that there is now a row.names column with the
  name of each university recorded. This means that R has given
  each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R
  will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However,
  we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the
  names are stored.
```{r}
college = college[,-1]
fix(college)
```
  ...Now you should see that the first data column is Private. Note
  that another column labeled row.names now appears before the
  Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather
  the name that R is giving to each row.
  
  
  (c) i. Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary
of the variables in the data set.
```{r}
summary(college)
```
  ii. Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of
  the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that
  you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using
  A[,1:10].
  

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
